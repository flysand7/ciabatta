ABOUT
  Ciabatta  -  An implementation of CRT for x86-64 windows and linux platforms.
The  goal  is  to  provide  a  platform-independent  CRT  with  the  purpose of
explicitly  defining  some  of platform-defined behaviours in order to simplify
the development and providing additional functionality to aid the developers in
writing cross-platform applications.

Note that Undefined Behaviour is impossible to define on a CRT level, since the
semantics  of the language can only be changed at the compiler level. Sometimes
the  compilers will replace CRT function calls with builtin functions, which is
meant  as  an optimization, e.g. replacing some forms of prinf() with puts() or
replacing  strlen with an x86 rep movsb instruction. Even if ciabatta does have
a  specific  behaviour  under  given  UB  conditions,  that  behaviour  is  not
guaranteed.

The goals:
  - Providing  API  for sockets, unicode processing (not just encodings), maybe
    the  support  for  common  image  and  data  file  formats and other useful
    non-standard functionality.
  - Making  it  easy  to  port  the library to a new platform, e.g. a custom OS
    kernel or a different processor architecture.
  - Defining  implementation-defined  behaviours  of  some of the functions and
    explicitly documenting them.
  - Make it reasonably fast compared to MSVCRT and GLIBC.

PLATFORM SUPPORT
  OS/Kernel:
  - Windows (64-bit)
  - TODO: Linux
  Processor Architecture
  - x86-64

USAGE
  NOTE: libwinsane.obj can be obtained by running:
    bake -DNO_CRT
  In the libwinsane directory.
  Add the following flags to your compilation command:
    -I <path/to/ciabatta/inc> libwinsane.obj -nostdlib -mfma
  Don't forget to link to the following libraries:
    -lciabatta.lib
